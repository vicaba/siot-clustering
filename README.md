# siot-clustering

This project implements a clustering algorithm and a rescheduling algorithm for the Social IoT, focusing on energy communities. 
The clustering algorithm groups prosumers by load shape compatibility, the partially distributed (two-phase) rescheduling algorithm minimizes energy consumption peaks.
